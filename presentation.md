# Paper Presentation
*Details for CS 6784 Fall 2023*

During the second half of the semester, students will present selected papers (list and sign up to come) and lead a discussion. 

Presentations should contain a discussion of
 - Motivation: What are the broader motivations for this work?
 - Problem statement: What is the specific problem that the paper tries to solve?
 - Prior work: How does this paper fit into the research landscape?
 - Main ideas/results: What are the main technical results and broader takeaways?
 - Technical tools: How do the authors support the results (e.g. proof techniques or experimental setup)? Be prepared to explain this in detail.
 - Future work: What are some shortcomings of this paper or directions for future work?

Students should elicit questions and comments from the class at multiple points during the presentation. The presentation should also highlight points of confusion or disagreement to discuss as a class. 

Students are required to schedule a meeting with the TA to go over their presentation at least two days before they are scheduled to present.
