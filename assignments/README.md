# Assignments for ML in Feedback Systems
*Cornell CS 6784 Fall 2023* 

This folder contains weekly assignments, posted each Wednesday and due the following Wednesday. 
Each assignment will contain a combination of required and suggested tasks.
Some suggested tasks have limited capacity; in this case, you must claim it as a Github "Issue" to avoid redundancy.
Once you have completed your assignment, you will submit your work as a Pull Request.
You will recieve feedback in the form of comments on the PR.

## Evaluation

We use a simplified scoring scheme for assignments (inspired by 6120 and 6110):
- 1 star: you complete the assignment reasonably well, whether everything is perfect or you have lots of mistakes.
- 2 stars: you do something surprisingly awesome. This is uncommon.
- no stars: your assignment has major gaps or significant misunderstanding. This is also uncommon.
Earning a gold star on every assignment achieves an A grade in the assignments category.

## Submitting your assignment

We will make use of GitHub's collaboration tools to collect your work.
The first assignment will help you set up and maintain a personal [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks) of this repository.
Each task within each assignment will involve additions or edits to files in the repository.
As you are working, you can [commit and push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git) to your fork. 
To submit the assignment, you will [create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with the main repository.

## Claiming a task

If a task is marked as *limited capacity*, you must claim it as a Github Issue to avoid redundancy.
Navigate to the [Issues tab](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository) to check all open issues.
If no one has claimed the task, [create an Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository).
The title should match the task title and the description should include any relevant details. 
Sometimes, it is possible for more than one student to work on a limited capacity tasks, as long and they coordinate.
For example, one student could focus on editing the text and providing new examples to a particular section in course notes, while another could focus on creating high quality diagrams and figures.
This coordination can be done by commenting on the issue.
