# Final Project
*Details for CS 6784 Fall 2023*

Key dates:
- October 6, 2023: Project proposal due
- November 10, 2023: Midterm update due
- December 4, 2023: Final report due

## Deliverables
All deliverables should use the PMLR format, created using the [LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fkdrmrfwgcfj). 
### Proposal
One page. Should include a tentative title, list of team members (up to four), and three sections: description of proposed topic, identifying key pieces of related work, and discussion of goals/proposed approach. Each section should be about one paragraph. No need to include an abstract.
### Midterm Update
Three or more pages. Should include a title, list of team members, abstract summarizing the topic and your progress, and three sections: related work, problem setting, and description of progress so far. 

Compared to the proposal, the related work section should include a detailed discussion of key papers as well as a broader discussion of other related work. The problem setting should formalize what you are studying and include a clear problem statement, research question, or goal. The description of progress should *demonstrate actual work* towards your goal, even if only partial progress or unsuccessful attempts. 
### Final Report
Five to six pages in the style of a conference submission with title, authors, abstract and at a minimum sections on: introduction, related work, problem setting, results, and conclusion/discussion. You will be evaluated on merit (is your approach justified?), depth (was the work technically challenging and the investigation deep?) and presentation (is the paper well written, are results clearly explained, visualized, interpreted?).
## Project Ideas
You are encouraged to propose a topic that connects class material to your research. You may also extend or reproduce the results of papers we read together in class, either analytically or in simulation. Another option is to develop or extend simulation environments and/or use them to investigate dynamical behaviors or compare algorithms. A third option is to write a survey paper that discusses the ideas of 3-5 closely related papers and maps directions for future work.
